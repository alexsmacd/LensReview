My Code Louisville FSJS Project. A web app designed to let photographers add lenses to the site and review each one, as well as edit as needed.

2. Run 'npm install' to install necessary packages
3. Run 'npm start' to begin the app server process
4. Open a localhost windows to the port it's running on
