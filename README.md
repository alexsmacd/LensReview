# LensReview â€” Code Louisville Full Stack JavaScript Project

My Code Louisville FSJS Project. A CRUD web application designed to let photographers add lenses to the site and review each one, as well as edit as needed.

1. Download this repository.
2. Create a .env file in the root of the downloaded repository, with the contents provided in the Google Form submission.
3. In your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the root folder of this project.

Thanks for reviewing!
